As women it can be hard to find other females in the tech industry to connect with and mentor/mentee. That's where the idea for Sage was born. We wanted it to be a place for women from all fields of technology and find each other and build relationships. A place for more experienced developers to share advice to those new to the field. A place for the new grad to find someone who understands what she's going through and can guide her to reach her full potential.

Sage was created by a team of six at WeHack 2017 in a span of 24 hours. Due to our team size and experience, we were able to have both a front-end and back end team for this project. I personally worked on the front-end, hacking away to create a visually appealing design and experience for the user.
